            <p>I first received the budget data from the MIL team. Data was found from budget recommendations created by the City of Chicago Office of Budget and Management, which are available to the public. I made a spreadsheet of all the numbers and decided on using a stacked line chart to show this data. When I put the numbers into Flourish, I realized they were adding all the numbers up (due to its stacked nature). In the original excel spreadsheet, I made sure to get the mental health services budget by subtracting the care budget and the total behavioral health budget by subtracting the mental health services budget. This way, when added up, there wouldnâ€™t be any redundancy and the graph would show accurate numbers. I added the source and credit, as well as made sure the design was accessible (screenreader, colorblind safe colors.)

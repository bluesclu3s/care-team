            <p>I first received the budget data from the MIL team, compiled by Janani Janarhanan. Data was found from the 2022-2025

                (titled: Mental health, behavioral health and CARE pilot funding from 2022-2025) of all the numbers and decided to use a stacked line chart to show this data. I did not use 2021 data because it was only starting from September of 2021 and would not accurately reflect the annual nature of other annual budget numbers. I put the numbers into Flourish to make a line graph. Due to the scale of the axis, it looked like there was no change in CARE funding at all (which was not true). I decided to make a story on Flourish (in which you can use multiple data visualizations to tell a story). The second line graph only includes data from  2023 - 2025 because I wanted to emphasize the drop that occurred this year. Then, I added the source and credit, as well as made sure the design was accessible (screen reader, colorblind safe colors) for both of the Flourishes.

            <p>I used data compiled by Janani Janarhanan on the behavioral and mental health budgets from the

                created by the City of Chicago Office of Budget and Management. I looked specifically at the 2025 column and the “Mental Health Services” and “Behavioral Health Budget” rows and directly pulled those numbers. For the budget planned for CARE, I used numbers from the MIL team’s FOIAs. I added the total CARE salaries from this 
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zy7hQJvMtA366DdZYAMae6QDmZq25RRD/edit?gid=1059861061#gid=1059861061">spreadsheet</a>

                Putting these into Flourish to show two-toned bars with the totals, I used a stacked bar chart template. The first column A had two items “Mental and Behavioral Health Total Budget” and “Planned CARE Budget.” Each had a corresponding number for the following four columns “Mental Health Budget,” “Behavioral Health Budget,” “Procurement Expenses” and “CARE Salaries,” and I just set the cell to $0 if the column header did not apply to the row. For example, I just put $0 under “Procurement Expenses” and “CARE Salaries” for the “Mental and Behavioral Health Total Budget” row. Under “Popups & panels,” I clicked “Custom” instead of “Auto” and did not write anything. Under “Labels,” I toggled on “Show labels for stack totals.”

            <p>I received data from the MIL team — the three important data points are the total department of public health spending, CARE spending, and mental health services spending. You can see these original numbers

                (pg. 213) the other two from the

                (CDPH on pg. 126; mental health services on pg. 127. IMPORTANT: note that these are the TOTAL funds, but CARE funding is only corporate funding — recommend standardizing this in future iterations of this visualization). In terms of processing – an example can be seen in the Pie Chart - CARE vs. Total Dept. of Public Health tab in this 
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLZ5dBEcR0qccz30B03tBFavq1np6-vhNcW6kkGlg0Y/edit?gid=1538837421#gid=1538837421">spreadsheet</a> (care_dep_health_edited_data). 
                The three original numbers fall under the types “Mental health services total”, “CARE”, and “Dept of Public Health total”. I created another type of funding - “All other spending”, and calculated it as the portion of the total department budget not accounted for (formula: =B3 - (B2 + B4)). I did the same for “mental health services total” – I created a new type called “All other mental health services” and calculated it as the difference between the total spending on mental health services and CARE (formula:  =B2 - B5). I didn’t include the Mental health services total row in my flourish visualization. I also calculated the percentage of total (column: “Percentage”) (formula: =B2/$B$3).  I didn’t include the department of public health total row in my flourish visualization. In terms of how I put the data into Flourish: I set the Labels/Time to be column A (Type), Values as Amount (Column B), and Info for Custom Popups to be C (Amount as percentage). I changed the colors so that All other mental health services were blue, All other spending was gray, and CARE was orange. I added a legend. I created custom popups that display both the amount and percentage spent, with the title set as “Type” (of spending). I then added a header and footer, along with a screen reader description.             </p>

                obtained by FOIA by Emma Sullivan to get the number of police officers trained in the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT). As it is in PDF form, I counted the number of names in a full page, coming out to 47, and multiplied that by the number of full pages in the PDF, which was 53. Then, I counted the number of names on the first page (46), which is not full due to the line for the column header, and the number of names on the last page (27), which was not full. I added these two numbers to the product I calculated earlier to get 2564 CIT-trained officers. Putting this into Flourish involved

                spreadsheet. I input the employee positions and number employed into a new spreadsheet. I didn’t have any salary info to add in for 2023. The 2024 and 2025 data came from the “2024-2025 total” tab of that same spreadsheet. For 2024, I used the data in the “2024 Total” column. However, I added the “Sr. Director of Crisis Services” position because that was unlisted but clearly a filled position as indicated on another tab of the spreadsheet and on LinkedIn. I did the same for the 2025 data, using the “Currently Filled” column. I input the new dataset into Flourish using the Stacked Bars template. Under chart settings, I switched the direction to horizontal for better visibility. Under colors, I created a set of custom overrides that are colorblind safe for accessibility purposes. I also added a legend, header and footer, source info and screen reader description.
